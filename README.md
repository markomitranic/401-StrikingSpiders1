#Hello World
This is a simple one. In this course we will start up from scratch. In the beginning you will get the whole solved example, in every next assignment you will get less and less. It is also recommended that after finishing the assignment, you think of and apply some of your own styles to the solution.

#COPY/PASTE
 I implore you to WRITE the code. Copying others code IS NOT THE SAME as using copy/paste. Do not copy/paste, i implore you to write as much as possible in these assignments. Read the examples, learn from them when you are stuck, use them to understand what is going on, you can even write the exact same code - but do not copy/paste.

 In this excersize it is recommended to look at the example model and use it as a guide.


#Instructions
Your assignment is to create a page with a simple grid. Header, Container and Footer. It will be nessecarry to implement many things that we have learned so far.

It contains a folder with a finished assignment.

In this excersize we will take a look at the very basics, HTML structure and folder structure. Linking the CSS to the HTML. Linking the Images into the page.
